# event-sourcing-example

Total work in progress. Messing around with [node-eventstore](https://github.com/adrai/node-eventstore) receiving messages from SQS and saving to mongo.

## To do:
* Listen to queue
* Persist events to mongo

## Nice to haves:
* Swap mongo for a relational db
* Validation on events
* Create snapshots
